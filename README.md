## Introduction

This project is built using Jakarta EE with Jakarta imports, Spring Data JPA, Spring MVC, Lombok, and Java SDK version

18. It features a simple Twitter-like application that allows creation, deletion, and retrieval of tweets.

## Getting Started

### Required Software

The following software is required:

1. **Maven**: Apache Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Download it
   from [here](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).
2. **Git**: Download and install from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
3. **Java, JDK 18**: Download and install from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/).
4. **Docker**: Download and install from [here](https://www.docker.com/).
5. **curl**: A command-line tool for testing HTTP-based APIs. Download and install
   from [here](https://curl.haxx.se/download.html).
6. **(Optional and convenient)**: Install SDKMAN from [here](https://sdkman.io/). SDKMAN is a tool for managing parallel
   versions of multiple Software Development Kits (SDKs) on most Unix-based systems.

Follow the installation guides on each software's website and verify the installations from the command line.

### Build, Up and Running Postgres Database

To run this application from an IDE, ensure you have a local Postgres database service up and running. Install Docker on
your machine and run the following script to download and configure the Postgres database:

```bash
cd ~/homework/src/main/docker/local/postgres/ && sh setup_postgres.sh
```

### Cloning the Project

Clone the project by opening **git bash** or command-line and running:

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/velsera/homework.git
```

### Build & Test in Isolation

Ensure Java is set to JDK 18 and Docker client (docker-desktop) is running. To build and run all test cases, execute:

```bash
mvn clean install -U
```

Successful build and test output should look like this:

```bash
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] Total time:  14.990 s
[INFO] Finished at: 2024-05-25T23:12:28+02:00
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

## Run the Service

Run the application from your IDE. Initially, activate the \`init\` profile so that Liquibase scripts can be executed:

![Initial Profile](support/init_profile.png)

Once completed, switch back to the default profile:

![Default Profile](support/default_profile.png)

## Dockerized Application

Ensure Docker Desktop is installed, up, and running.

### Building Docker Image

To build the Docker image and run the application in a Docker container, execute this script from the root folder:

```bash
sh ./dockerize_application.sh
```

### Verify the Application is up and Running

Successful start message in the terminal should look like:

```bash
